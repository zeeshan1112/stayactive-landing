## üöÄ Installation

### Download the Application

Choose the correct version for your Mac's chip:

* **[Download for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs) - v1.0.1](https://github.com/zeeshan1112/StayActive/releases/download/v1.0.1/StayActive_1.0.1_AppleSilicon.dmg)**
* **[Download for Intel Mac - v1.0.1](https://github.com/zeeshan1112/StayActive/releases/download/v1.0.1/StayActive_1.0.1_Intel.dmg)**

**How to check your Mac's chip:**
Click the Apple menu Ô£ø in the top-left corner of your screen and choose **"About This Mac."** Look for "Chip" or "Processor."

### Important Setup Steps

For StayActive to function correctly and simulate activity, granting **Accessibility permission** is crucial. macOS security features require this to allow the app to control mouse events.

1.  **Initial Launch Bypass (Gatekeeper):**
    * After downloading the `.dmg` file, drag `StayActive.app` to your Applications folder.
    * The first time you try to open it, macOS Gatekeeper might block it because it's an unsigned app downloaded from the internet.
    * If you see a "StayActive cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" message, click **Cancel**.
    * Go to **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS) > **Privacy & Security**.
    * Scroll down to the "Security" section. You'll likely see a message like "StayActive was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer." Click **"Open Anyway."**
    * Confirm by clicking "Open" in the subsequent dialog.

2.  **Granting Accessibility Permission:**
    * Upon its first successful launch, StayActive will prompt you to grant Accessibility permissions.
    * Click **"Open System Settings"** (or "Open System Preferences").
    * In the Privacy & Security settings, scroll down to **"Accessibility"**.
    * Click the **lock icon** at the bottom left to make changes (you'll need to enter your password).
    * Find **"StayActive"** in the list and **check the box** next to it to enable permission.
    * Close System Settings and restart StayActive.

After these steps, StayActive will run discreetly in your menu bar.

## üí° How to Use

Once installed and permissions are granted:

1.  Launch **StayActive.app** from your Applications folder.
2.  Look for the **StayActive icon** (your app icon) in your macOS menu bar.
3.  Click the icon to reveal the menu:
    * **Start:** Begins the mouse movement to keep your Mac active. The menu item will change to "Running..."
    * **Stop:** Halts the mouse movement.
    * **About StayActive:** Opens the app's GitHub page.
    * **Quit:** Exits the application.
